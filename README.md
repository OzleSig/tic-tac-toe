# Tic-tac-toe
This is my repo for a pygame enhanced tic tac toe game.

## Progress so far
I have played around with pygame and been able to draw a square which moves around with events (up, down, left and right). I have also drawn a grid with variables for sizing and positioning. I have added the mouse location (x, y) which is being printed on terminal when running.

## Planned changes
Next I will be printing the coordinates of the grid the mouse is in instead of the screen location. Apparently this is called collision therapy.
