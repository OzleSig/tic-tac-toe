# Tic-tac-toe
This is my repo for a pygame enhanced tic tac toe game.

## Progress so far
I have played around with pygame and been able to draw a square which moves around with events (up, down, left and right). I have also drawn a grid which takes user input from terminal for sizing of the grid boxes.

## Planned changes
I will take text input within the game screen for the sizing instead.
