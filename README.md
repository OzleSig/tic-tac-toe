# Tic-tac-toe
This is my repo for a pygame enhanced tic tac toe game. I have already made a tic tac toe game played from the terminal, so this will be a continuation of that project.

## Progress so far
* Drawn grid with variables for sizing and positioning (I might change this later to depend on the screen size)
* Grid position of the mouse (collision detection)
* Changed hover boxes on user input on grid to grey X or O 
* Drawn X or O on grid using 2d list in code
* Added changing score over matches
* Game resets on a draw
* Winning row/colomn/diagonal indicated in red

## Planned changes
* Refactor the code
