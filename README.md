# Tic-tac-toe
This is my repo for a pygame enhanced tic tac toe game. I have already made a tic tac toe game played from the terminal, so this will be a continuation of that project.

## Progress so far
* Drawn grid with variables for sizing and positioning (I might change this later to depend on the screen size)
* Grid position of the mouse (collision detection)
* Change the colour of the grid box hovered over

## Planned changes
* Draw X and O on grid
* Bring in tic tac toe game logic
* Player indicator and score
