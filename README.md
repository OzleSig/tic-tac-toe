# Tic-tac-toe
This is my repo for a pygame enhanced tic tac toe game.

## Progress so far
I have played around with pygame and been able to draw a square which moves around with events (up, down, left and right). I have also drawn a grid for later use.

## Planned changes
I will be making a function to draw a grid given box sizes and positioning.
